        <p>Let's Get Lit!! began as a love affair for the written word.  Since a child I have voraciously consumed books in every genre, from thrillers, to romance, murder mysteries, adventure, young adult, fantasy, and the like.  I simply love reading and immersing myself in another world.  As a result, I have instilled in my children the love of reading and tubs of books can be found throughout my house.
        </p>
            
        <p>I currently listen to 1 book per day through the use of audiobooks, but what I have discovered is that it takes quite a bit of time to find something new to read.  I've used goodreads extensively to log my books, and adore that Amazon keeps track of all of my past purchases to recommend new books, but I have not been able to simply browse an online book store and get a synopsis of a book or a recommendation that appeals to me as a reader.</p>
        
        <p>While at work I don't have vast amounts of time to spend searching for something to listen to, so I need to find something intersting quick, fast, and in a hurry.  No site anywhere provides that.  This gave birth to Let's Get Lit!!! where synopses are in your face front and center and within 10 -15 seconds you'll know exactly if a book is for you.  Whether you prefer to read a quick summary or watch a highlight reel, Let's Get Lit!!! makes it possible.</p>
